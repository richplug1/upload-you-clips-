# üí≥ Credit-Based Subscription System

## Overview

The Upload You Clips application now includes a comprehensive credit-based subscription system that controls video processing based on user plans and credit consumption.

## üéØ How It Works

### Credit Calculation Formula

Credits are consumed based on video processing complexity:

```
Total Credits = Base Cost + Duration Cost + Complexity Bonus

Where:
- Base Cost = Number of clips √ó 1 credit
- Duration Cost = Video minutes √ó 0.1 credit  
- Complexity Bonus = 0.5 credit per clip (for videos > 10 minutes)
```

### Example Calculations

| Video Duration | Clips | Base Cost | Duration Cost | Complexity | Total |
|---------------|-------|-----------|---------------|------------|-------|
| 2 minutes     | 3     | 3         | 0.2          | 0          | 4     |
| 5 minutes     | 5     | 5         | 0.5          | 0          | 6     |
| 15 minutes    | 10    | 10        | 1.5          | 5          | 17    |
| 30 minutes    | 20    | 20        | 3.0          | 10         | 33    |

  onUpgradeClick={() => setShowPlans(true)}
  onBuyCreditsClick={() => setShowBuyCredits(true)}
/>
```

```

## üîê Backend Integration

### Credit Middleware
The system includes middleware to automatically check credits and subscription limits:

```javascript
const { checkVideoProcessingCredits } = require('../middleware/creditMiddleware');

router.post('/process',
  authService.authenticateToken,
  checkVideoProcessingCredits, // Automatic credit checking
  async (req, res) => {
    // Credits already checked and deducted
    // Process video...
  }
);
```

### Database Schema
The system uses three main tables:
- `subscriptions` - User subscription plans
- `credits` - User credit balances
- `credit_transactions` - Credit usage history

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

- **Authentication Required**: All credit operations require valid JWT tokens
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse with request rate limiting
- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with detailed logging

## üìä Analytics & Monitoring

### Credit Usage Tracking
- Real-time credit balance updates
- Detailed transaction history
- Usage patterns and trends

### Subscription Analytics
- Plan conversion rates
- Credit utilization rates
- Revenue tracking

## üîÑ Auto-Renewal & Billing

### Monthly Credit Refresh
```javascript
// Automatic monthly reset for all active subscriptions
await database.resetMonthlyCredits();
```

### Credit Expiration
- Credits refresh monthly for paid plans
- Unused credits don't roll over
- Free plan credits reset monthly

## üé≠ Demo Mode

The current implementation includes demo payment processing:
- No real charges are made
- All payments are simulated
- Perfect for testing and development

To integrate real payments, replace the demo payment handlers with:
- Stripe integration
- PayPal integration
- Other payment providers

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Credit system settings
CREDIT_RATE_LIMIT=100
SUBSCRIPTION_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret
PAYMENT_PROVIDER=demo
```

### Plan Configuration
Plans are currently hardcoded but can be moved to database configuration for dynamic pricing.

## üìà Future Enhancements

1. **Real Payment Integration**
   - Stripe/PayPal integration
   - Webhook handling for payment events
   - Automatic subscription management

2. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Usage prediction
   - Cost optimization recommendations
   - Business intelligence dashboard

3. **Enterprise Features**
   - Custom pricing
   - Volume discounts
   - API rate limiting by plan

4. **Mobile App Support**
   - React Native components
   - Mobile payment integration
   - Push notifications for low credits

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Insufficient Credits" Error**
   - Check current credit balance

   - Ensure credits weren't already deducted

2. **"Plan Limit Exceeded" Error**
   - Confirm video duration vs plan limits

process.env.DEBUG = 'credits:*';

// Check credit calculation
const cost = calculateCreditCost(duration, clipsCount);
console.log('Credit cost:', cost);

// Verify user subscription
const subscription = await database.getUserSubscription(userId);
console.log('User subscription:', subscription);
```
